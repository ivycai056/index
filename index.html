    <h2 class = "move-slightly">Introduction</h2>
<div class = "box">
    <p>The Republic of China is a leading country in the world in terms of not only technological advancement but also many other factors such as their rich cultural background and beliefs that are vastly different from its western counterparts. When comparing modern China to that of the early establishment of the Republic of China, the country has seen an immense growth in technology, even surpassing those who were considered far more advanced a couple of decades ago. However, when seeing the isolationist-driven country through the lens of a western perspective, it becomes difficult to understand why and how the country operates. Hence, when delving into the ethical aspects within modern China, one must first remove themselves from their biased viewpoint and to possess an in-depth knowledge in order to fully comprehend its current establishments of law and regulations.</p>

        <p>Throughout Chinese history, the main national policy that has persisted is isolationism. While China had interacted with other countries, the idea of isolationism intensified as the western powers tried to bring its influence to East Asia. In a way, China is similar to that of the United States when it was first established. Neither country wanted to be involved with the rest of the world, but was forced to due to conflicts and war. In addition, China also has issues dealing with the various ethnic minorities within the country as opposed to the issue of racial inequality that the United States have. However, as globalization occurred, the United States promoted the idea of immigration in order to improve the economy. Meanwhile, China had a different approach of advancing by improving its technology.</p>
