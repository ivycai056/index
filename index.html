    <h1 class= "bottom-border">  A Global Case Study: Social Security System in China </h1>
    <h2 class = "move-slightly">Introduction</h2>
<div class = "box">
    <p>The Republic of China is a leading country in the world in terms of not only technological advancement but also many other factors such as their rich cultural background and beliefs that are vastly different from its western counterparts. When comparing modern China to that of the early establishment of the Republic of China, the country has seen an immense growth in technology, even surpassing those who were considered far more advanced a couple of decades ago. However, when seeing the isolationist-driven country through the lens of a western perspective, it becomes difficult to understand why and how the country operates. Hence, when delving into the ethical aspects within modern China, one must first remove themselves from their biased viewpoint and to possess an in-depth knowledge in order to fully comprehend its current establishments of law and regulations.</p>

    <h3 class = "move-slightly">Country Information</h2>
        <p>Throughout Chinese history, the main national policy that has persisted is isolationism. While China had interacted with other countries, the idea of isolationism intensified as the western powers tried to bring its influence to East Asia. In a way, China is similar to that of the United States when it was first established. Neither country wanted to be involved with the rest of the world, but was forced to due to conflicts and war. In addition, China also has issues dealing with the various ethnic minorities within the country as opposed to the issue of racial inequality that the United States have. However, as globalization occurred, the United States promoted the idea of immigration in order to improve the economy. Meanwhile, China had a different approach of advancing by improving its technology.</p>
    <h3 class = "move-slightly">Ethical Theories/Values</h3>
        <p>When looking into China’s laws and regulations, it is crucial to understand the difference of ethical values and theories that they have compared to western virtues. Since China is heavily influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, the core values that they hold are non-attachment and tranquility. Their values heavily differ as opposed to the western perspective of justice and bravery. While the people in China have these core values of peace and virtue, the recent implementation of the social credit system has been an issue of invasion of privacy. However, when looking at a recent article on the approval rating of the social credit system in China, 80% of the Chinese citizens are actually satisfied with the current system. While looking through it in a western perspective, we might perceive the social credit system as a policy that invades our right to privacy. Nonetheless, the citizens of China see it as a sign of trustworthiness (Kostka 2019). An example being that if a business has a low social credit score, then it is an indication that the business is untrustworthy and should not be invested in. In addition to China’s social credit system, the way that it is being managed is through facial recognition technologies in surveillance cameras. The issue with the system is that it may prohibit Chinese citizens from expressing their true opinions whether on the internet or in the actual world. If they were to say something that goes against what the Chinese government thinks as “good” then their social credit score may go down. This can go all the way until the person becomes black-listed. The negative consequences of being black-listed include: a limited transportation system, inability to start up a new business (without a bad reputation), inability to go to school and many more (Donnelly 2021). While it may be intended for good, there are still harmful and unfair consequences to those who are less privileged. For example, if a person were to be raised in a less privileged and crime heavy area, the environment would most likely influence their behavior as they grow older. However, with the new social credit system, it would ultimately make it harder for the individual to start a new life without the negative setbacks it would create. Hence, the less privileged would continue to be stuck in the system whereas the more privileged would see the social credit system as a sign of security and trustworthiness. </p>
    <h3 class = "move-slightly">Codes of Ethics-International Laws</h3>
        <p>There are many new laws that are currently being drafted regarding the social credit system. For example, the Social Credit Law has been in implementation since 2014 and is being used as an outline of what it will be like to implement the law into society. Additionally, another law that is currently in draft form is the ‘Plan on Building the Rule of Law in China (2020-2025)’ that focuses on the progress of the social credit system. There is also the National Basic List of Punishment Measures for Untrustworthiness that explains how all of the punishments are given. </p>
    <h3 class = "move-slightly">ACM Codes of Ethics</h3>
        <p>The main essential problem that the Social Credit System is trying to solve is to decrease bad behaviors and increase trust. While there are other newer issues that need to be addressed from the structure of the system, the initial intention of the project is to avoid harm (1.2). The project is created so that individuals will have to think before acting upon something that would negatively affect their social scores. As stated in the Public Credit Information Catalog, most of the consequences only take effect if the person has repeatedly done something that is harmful to another person in order to benefit themselves. Hence, in order to avoid harm, one must value honesty and trustworthiness (1.3). The whole law is built on the importance of trustworthiness and that individuals and businesses should be transparent about their actions in a way that is ethical.</p>
    <h3 class = "move-slightly">Stakeholders</h3>
        <p>The main stakeholders within this study case are the Chinese government, the citizens, policy enforcers, and businesses/companies. The reason why the Chinese government is one of the main stakeholders is because they are the ones who created the laws. They get to decide on how extreme the law should be and how it should be carried out. The impact of the law is directly towards the citizens who live in China and are being affected by the Social Credit System. They are typically the one with the least amount of power (unless unioned together) and those who have to abide by the laws. They decide whether or not the law is just or unjust and is usually the one that is most impacted by the system. More specifically, those who are less fortunate would be more impacted by the laws when compared to those who are wealthier and have connections with other stakeholders such as the law enforcers or the government. The law enforcers are those who carry out the law after it is created by the government. Law enforcers are typically local government officials who implement the laws throughout different regions within the country. Another group of stakeholders would be those who run businesses or companies as they will also be another main stakeholder that would have to abide by the rules and regulations.</p>
    <h3 class = "move-slightly">Ethical Dilemma Question/Solutions</h3>
        <p>The Social Credit System was created with the intention of reporting trustworthiness between individuals and companies within China. While it may eliminate those issues, will the negative consequences become a bigger issue to those who are already disadvantaged in the long term? There are many solutions to solving this issue: regulation, transparency and protection. The first two are simple, first, the laws must be regularly corrected and checked for it to stay up to date. In addition, it must correct areas where a certain group of people are not able to loop around the system. Secondly, the process of how the social credit system works should be transparent. Lastly, there must be additional laws created to protect those who are already disadvantaged, such as those with mental disabilities or those who are in a low socioeconomic status.</p>
